The easiest way to customize the design of your Genesis theme, right from the WordPress Customizer.


== Description ==

Genesis Super Customizer adds options to customize colors, create a fixed header that shrinks on scroll, upload logos, edit footer credits, and much more, all through the native Wordpress Customizer interface.
It's the easiest way to customize the design of the Genesis theme or your custom Genesis child theme.

There's over 100 options to customize and tinker with, but you can easily change the look and feel of your Genesis theme with just a few options.

You can import and export your design templates. Use them as starter templates to speed up your design process.

More information can be found at [http://supercustomizer.com](http://supercustomizer.com "Genesis Super Customizer").

Please note this plugin requires the Genesis theme (a premium WordPress theme) to be activated.


== Installation ==

1. Upload genesis-super-customzer.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the Wordpress Customizer to change and adjust settings.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install a customizer template? =

From your WordPress admin navigate to the Genesis > Import/Export menu. Click "Choose File"
and location your .json customizer template file. Click "Upload File and Import". You should see
a success notification on the top.

= How do I export my genesis super customizer setting to a template? =

Just like importing a template, navigate to the Genesis > Import/Export menu. Check "Customizer Settings" under the Export Genesis Settings File dialog. Then click the Download Export File button.

= How do I reset the genesis super customizer options? =

In the current version, you need to upload the default settings .json file. You can find that template at [http://supercustomizer.com/downloads/genesis-default-settings/](http://supercustomizer.com/downloads/genesis-default-settings/ "Genesis Super Customizer Default Settings").
Import the same as you would any other template (instructions above). There are future plans for a simple reset button.

= Does it work with premium Genesis child themes? =

At the moment Genesis Super Customizer isn't tested with premium child themes. It is meant to replace the need to edit your CSS file in your Genesis parent theme custom child theme.
It should work fine with just about any custom child theme, but options on premium themes work will probably not work correctly. There are future plans to incorporate add-ons for premium child themes.
